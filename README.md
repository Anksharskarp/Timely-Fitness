## Timely Fitness
--------------------------
*    The official documentation and presentation for this Android application can be found at the GitHub Pages website for this repository:
     [https://anksharskarp.github.io/Timely-Fitness/](https://anksharskarp.github.io/Timely-Fitness/)
*    Make sure you read the [NOTICE.md](https://github.com/Anksharskarp/Timely-Fitness/blob/master/NOTICE.md) file for an important disclaimer
     about the external code/libraries/dependencies that I used in my project and how I gave credit to the code that others wrote.
*    I (William Zhang) am not responsible for any damages to devices if you download the APK from the releases tab. Up to this point, I have not tested the code, 
     and cannot give any guarantees about the safety and quality of my code until I learn ~~to stop complaining about the incessant bugs in my code~~ to use JUnit or JBoss
     for testing.
*    If you want to contribute, email me at [aerialconnection98@gmail.com](aerialconnection98@gmail.com).
*    Credits to [brodeurlv](https://www.github.com/brodeurlv), because I used his Android app as a template for mine ~~to highlight how terrible I am at Android
     development~~(nobody saw that). The project's software license permitted the reuse of some of his `CSV` parsing functions, which were super helpful to me 
     for data storage on one's local device. If you are interested in helping him out on his project, check it out at:
